## Learning objectives
- Describe the difference between WAN,PAN and LAN
- List the different network protocols and network standards
- Describe network communication concepts like the TCP/IP model,DNS and ports
- Describe how these core concepts map to cloud

## What is a network ?
- A collection of network-enabled devices ie computers,switches,routers,printers and servers.

## Network types
- Personal(example where a smartphone,laptop or tablet all connect through a Bluetooth)
- Local area networks(networking needs around a single location-needs authenication or authorization)
- Metropolitan area network(within2 different locations in a city)
- Wide area(between 2 different geographical locations locally or worldwide)-a VPN is used to manage connections

# Network topologies
- A network topology the the physical composition of a network 
- Bus topology(each network device is connected to a single network cable)

- Star topology(each network connects to a centralized switch)

- Ethernet is synonymous with wire-based LAN networks and also used in MAN and LAN networks
- Fast Ethernet(IEEE 802.3u)-developed to support data transmission speeds of upto 100 Mbps,also known as the 100BASE-TX standard
- Gigabit Ethernet(IEEE 802.3ab)-supports faster communication network to support streaming multimedia and Voice over IP
- 10 Gigabit Ethernet(IEEE 802.3ab)-transfers data speeds of 10Gbps
- Terabit Ethernet-transfers data speeds of 200Gbps and 400Gbps

## Amazon VPC 
- A service that allows you to create isolated virtual networks which can be used to launch AWS resources
- Subnets-segments of the VPC where you place resources
